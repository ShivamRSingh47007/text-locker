# TextLocker

**TextLocker** is a custom Python application designed to **lock text in PDFs**, making it impossible to copy directly.  
The application **converts each page into images internally and recreates a secured PDF**, preventing text extraction while keeping the content readable.  

This tool is **specially optimized for speed** and made for personal use, combining a simple GUI with efficient processing.
